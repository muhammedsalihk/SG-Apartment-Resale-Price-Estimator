# SG Apartment Resale Price Estimator

## Introduction

The Housing and Development Board (HDB) is a state controlled authority that is responsible for public housing in Singapore. They develop and maintain a large variety of flat types and layouts catering to different house budgets. 

Singapore Citizens can lease out these flats for a period of 99 years. But for permanent residents, they can make purchase only from the secondary resale market. And we can see that there is a thriving market for the resale of the HDB flats with nearly 1500 transactions happening every month.

Since there is no stipulated method for determining the resale price, it is vital that the buyer is able to gauge the real value of the property so that they are able to negotiate properly for the sale. It can also help the seller to set a reasonable price for the sale.

Here, we are building an accurate predictor for the resale price based on the data available on previous sales.
